    <h4 class="h4-color">about</h4>
    <p class="p-color">
        Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.<br>
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.<br>
        Designers are toolmakers.<br>
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.<br>
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.<br>
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.
